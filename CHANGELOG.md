# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Roadmap

- **Coming in v0.3.0: automated content ingestion** — LLM-driven extraction of
  entities and concepts from your sources into typed Anytype Objects with
  bidirectional Relations, turning the v0.2.0 foundation into a full LLM wiki.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-30

First public release (preview). This is the first open-source release of
`anytype-llm-wiki` and marks the start of public versioning.

### Added

- **`wiki-bootstrap` command** — provisions the dedicated wiki schema (Types,
  Properties, domain tags, and a root Collection) in an Anytype space. The
  operation is idempotent: it is safe to run repeatedly and reconciles the space
  to the expected schema without creating duplicates, including an in-place
  schema-upgrade path. Flags: `--space-id` (required), `--domain-tags`,
  `--dry-run`, and `--json`.
- **`doctor` command** — a read-only preflight health check that verifies
  connectivity and readiness across the Anytype API, Qdrant, and Ollama, and
  confirms the configured embedding model is available. It changes nothing and
  exits `0` only when every check passes, making it suitable for setup
  validation. Flag: `--json`.
- **Public-release collateral** — security policy (`SECURITY.md`), third-party
  attribution (`NOTICE`), contribution and licensing guidance (`CONTRIBUTING.md`),
  and documentation of the project's supply-chain posture (two-layer dependency
  pinning: exact, hashed versions in `uv.lock` for reproducible installs, with
  compatible ranges declared in `pyproject.toml`).

### Foundation

This release builds on the existing semantic-search foundation:

- The MCP server (run with `anytype-llm-wiki`, no arguments) exposes the
  `semantic_search` and `reindex_anytype` tools to MCP clients such as Claude
  Desktop, Cursor, and Claude Code.
- Indexing is incremental: only objects that changed since the last run are
  re-embedded. Trigger a reindex with the `reindex_anytype` tool (the first
  `semantic_search` also prompts a reindex when the collection is empty).
